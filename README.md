# Angular2 Minimal Starter

> A starter kit featuring:
* Router
* Component
* Dependence Injection
* Core Directives
* Custom Directives
* Form Builder (pending - broken in version alpha28)

## Goal
Maintain an up-to-date project using the very latest version of Angular2, while keep improving and using more Angular2's features. Thus anyone can use it as an extremely minimal base to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript (using Webpack for assisting with boilerplate).

## Quick start
```bash
# 1. Clone / Download the repo.
$ npm start # 2.
# 3. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080
```
#### Tested on
* Node.js 0.12.5
* Chrome browser 43+
* Firefox 38+

#### Use a TypeScript-aware editor for view or edit the code.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)
